# Map of the ZX-community

Map of all the people working on ZX-calculus related topics. This map is naturally incomplete, so please add to it as you see fit. As you can see, some people currently have no topic associated to them, so please add topics as well.

Though the map started out roughly following physical proximity, this has been mostly dropped due to size constraints. Please move groups of people around if it leads to a clearer diagram.
